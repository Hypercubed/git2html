DESCRIPTION
-----------

git2html is a simple git web interface. Unlike other web interfaces,
git2html does not generate content dynamically: instead of using a CGI
script, it generates static HTML pages.

Generating static HTML pages has advantages and disadvantages.  The
main advantages are that it is more secure and more robust.  It is
more robust in the sense that web server configuration changes are
unlikely to cause the interface to stop working.  Its primary
disadvantage is that because the pages are generated statically, not
all queries can be supported, e.g., diffs between arbitrary revisions.
Despite this seemingly dehabilitating disadvantage, the output is
surprisingly useful.

USAGE
-----

The first time you run git2html, you need to indicate your project's
name (-p), the link for viewers to clone the repository (-l), the
repository to get updates from (-r) and the target directory.

Here is how I configured git2html's viewer directory:

 $ ./git2html.sh \
     -p git2html \
     -l http://hssl.cs.jhu.edu/~neal/git2html.git \
     -r /home/neal/public_html/git2html.git 
     ~/public_html/git2html/src/

Note that this first run will take a fair amount of time.  git2html
tries to be smart and avoids doing a fair amount of redundant work on
subsequent runs.

Subsequent runs only require the target directory (git2html saves the
configuration in the target directory in the .ht_git2html file).

After commiting to git2html's repository, the following command is
run:

 $ ./git2html.sh ~/public_html/git2html/src/
